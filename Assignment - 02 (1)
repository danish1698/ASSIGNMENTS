1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans. A boolean can have two values: True or False.
     They are use to compare the values and expression
     eg - 
     x = "Hello"
     y = 15
     print(bool(x))
     print(bool(y)
     
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans. AND operator
     OR  operator
     NOT operator
    
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
   values for the operator and what it evaluate).    
Ans.AND operator
    test_list = [True, True, False, True, False]
    print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))
    res = all(test_list)
    print("Result after performing AND among elements : " + str(res))
    
    OR operator
    test_list = [True, True, False, True, False]
    print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))
    res = any(test_list)
    print("Result after performing OR among elements : " + str(res))
   
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
   (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                = False
    not (5 > 4)                        = False
   (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                 = True
   not((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))            = False
   (True and True) and (True == False) = False
   (not False) or (not True)           = True
   
5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans. less than (<)
     Greater than (>)
     Less than or equal to (<=)
     Greater than or equal to (>=)
     Equal to (==)
     Not equal to (!=)
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
   condition and when you would use one.    
Ans. a single equal symbol'=' is called an assignment operator,which is use to assigns values to a variable
     whereas double '==' is called a comparison or equal to operator which is used in the comparison of two variables        and return a boolean statement.

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
   spam = 0
   if spam == 10:    
     print('eggs')    -- block 1
     if spam > 5:    
       print('bacon') -- block2
     else:
        print('ham')  -- block3
      print('spam')
   print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
   greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans. spam = int(input())
     if spam ==  1:
       print("hello")
     elif spam == 2:
       print("Howdy")
     else:
       print("Greatings!")
       
9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?       
Ans. Ctrl + C       

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans. Break statement is used to terminate the loop or statement in which it is present.    
     whereas continue statement is opposite to the break statement , it forces to execute the next iteration           
       
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans.They all do the same thing. so there is no difference between them
       
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.       
Ans. For loop
     for i in range(1,11):
     print(i)
     
     While loop
     i = 1
     while i<=10:
       print(i)
       i = i+1
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
Ans. first we  import module spam and then we import the function bacon()
